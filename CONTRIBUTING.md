## üíª Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ & npm
- Python 3.12+
- Git & **Git LFS** (required for model weights)
- Supabase account (for database)

### Install Git LFS

Before cloning, ensure Git LFS is installed to properly download model files:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

**Windows:**
1. Download from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
2. Install and run: `git lfs install`

**Verify:**
```bash
git lfs version
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone with LFS
git clone https://github.com/A1maan/Rukn.git
cd Rukn

# Verify model files downloaded correctly
git lfs ls-files
# Should show .pt files in backend/models/
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run the backend
python -m app.main
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

## üìù Coding Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Document functions with docstrings
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable names (prefer `urgency_score` over `us`)

**Example:**
```python
def analyze_urgency(text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze urgency level of Arabic mental health text.
    
    Args:
        text: Input text in Arabic
        
    Returns:
        dict: Contains urgency level and confidence score
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components under 300 lines (split if larger)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (avoid inline styles)

**Example:**
```typescript
interface AnalysisResult {
  urgency: UrgencyLevel;
  emotion: Emotion;
  confidence: number;
}

function useAnalysis(text: string): AnalysisResult | null {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Accessibility

- Include ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Support screen readers
- Test with Arabic RTL layout

### Internationalization

- Use i18next for all user-facing text
- Support both Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR)
- Extract all strings to translation files
- Test layouts in both directions
