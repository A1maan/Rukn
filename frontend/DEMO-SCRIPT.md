## üé§ Q&A Prep

**Q**: Is the data real?  
**A**: "Currently mocked for demo, but the schema matches our MarBERT sentiment analysis output. Backend integration is next."

**Q**: What about privacy?  
**A**: "All text is PII-masked upstream. The dashboard only shows aggregated metrics and anonymized phrases."

**A**: "Yes! The NLP model is MarBERT (Arabic-first), and the UI supports RTL (to be added in next sprint)."

**Q**: How fast is it?  
**A**: "Designed for sub-second updates. With SSE (server-sent events), supervisors see alerts within 10 seconds of detection."

**Q**: What's the EWI formula?  
**A**: "0.4 √ó Distress + 0.25 √ó Negative Sentiment + 0.2 √ó Risk Rate + 0.15 √ó Operational Complaints. Tuned with historical data."

**Q**: Can we customize thresholds?  
**A**: "Yes! The system is configurable ‚Äî you can adjust sensitivity per region or time of day."
